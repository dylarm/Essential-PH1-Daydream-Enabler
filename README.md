# Essential PH-1 Daydream Enabler ("Google Pixelifier")

There is nothing insufficient about the Magisk module from saved-j that allowed
Daydream to run on nearly any phone.
In fact, it worked a little too well.
Installing the original Daydream Enabler module fooled everything so well that
the Essential camera app no longer recognized the phone, and instead of
properly running, instead opened a link for you to buy the Essential PH-1.

While the Essential camera app is of relatively worse quality that any Gcam
port, it is also the *only* camera app that can access the monochrome sensor.

This may or may not be important to you, but I personally like using the
monochrome sensor at times.

So, I removed settings one by one until both the Essential camera app and
Daydream both ran without any (apparent) problems.

**Note**: This is (likely) not the most minimal set of options/properties
to get Daydream to run on the Essential PH-1.
It's just the first working one that I found.
